This website is still a work in progress, incase you have anything to suggest, join us on our modding discord!

## ⚠️ Old GT5/GT6 online players, we need your help!

Some online assets from back in the day may be lost to time, but you may be able to fix that! On June 17th, 2023, we managed to recover *12 GB* worth of online GTTV movies from GT5/GT6!

GT5 temporarily stored assets such as Gran Turismo TV movies, museum files and more on the hard drive. Seasonals & GT6 custom tracks can also be recovered if you had replays of them.

If you think you have any of these especially the former, we **urge you to [mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGS_Ryx_7r8) your console** to retrieve these files for archival! If you already have a modded console and think you have GT5/GT6 assets, check under the `dev_hdd0/game/<Game Code>/grim2/file/contents` folder if you can find anything there. For replays, simply check ingame.

Contact Nenkai on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nenkaai) or on Discord (nenkai) if you can help!
