# Textures

PS2-era GT Textures uses the [Tex1](../../formats/texture/img_tex1_textureset.md) format. 

## Viewing

Textures can be viewed with [GTMP](https://github.com/adeyblue/GTVolTools). May require compilation however.

## Editing/Creation

Tex1 textures can be created, however the tool is currently not yet released (in testing phase).
