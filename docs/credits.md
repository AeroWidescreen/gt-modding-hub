# Credits

The gran turismo modding community was nearly inexistent before 2020. It wouldn't be what it is today without the support, motivation, donations, and help of many people who have been here far before I (Nenkai) was.

!!! tip ""
    It is only beneficial to attribute proper credits to the people who have spent countless days and nights reverse-engineering and even documenting the process and spread awareness to allow more people to be involved. Thanks if you do!
