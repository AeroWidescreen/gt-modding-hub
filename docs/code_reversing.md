# IDA/Ghidra Databases

IDA/Ghidra databases are available [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/l6hdjyuhcjbo5tr/GT_RE.zip/file) for most games between PS2-PS4 (last updated - July 2nd 2024).

You may need:

- PS4:
    * [PS4 Module Loader](https://github.com/SocraticBliss/ps4_module_loader)

- PS3:
    * [Ps3GhidraScripts](https://github.com/clienthax/Ps3GhidraScripts)
    * For GT6's IDB: CELL_PPU_PROC from [`ps3_ghidra`](tools/ps3_ghidra-master.zip) - not sure about the author, this file was almost lost to time. You might have to manually upgrade it for newer ghidra versions to accept it

- PS2 (Note: CORE files built with [GT4ElfBuilderTool](https://github.com/Nenkai/PDTools)):
    * [Ghidra Emotion Engine: Reloaded](https://github.com/chaoticgd/ghidra-emotionengine-reloaded)
    * IRX Files: [Ghidra IRX](https://github.com/Ziemas/ghidra_irx)

- PSP:
    * [Ghidra Allegrex](https://github.com/kotcrab/ghidra-allegrex)
